üéÆ eSports Arena
Welcome to eSports Arena, a full-stack web platform for discovering, hosting, and participating in esports tournaments and community-run scrims. This project is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and features a modern, responsive user interface.

The platform separates official, pro-level tournaments from user-created community events, providing a tailored experience for both professional players and the wider gaming community.
